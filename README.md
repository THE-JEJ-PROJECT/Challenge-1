Challenge 01 - CCOM4995

Building a simple and nice small house.

Steps:
1.  The left front door was added as a cube with 3x3 scale on its X & Y axis; same thing with the right front door.

2.  A 1x1 cube was positioned in between these walls and then elevated to simulate the empty door frame.

3.  The left wall used the same Y scale as the front walls, but its X scale was set to 7. Its Y rotation was set to 90 degrees 
    so that it was perpendicular to the front walls. Then this was copied, pasted and moved to the other side to make up the right wall.

4.  For the final wall we copied the prior wall and set its Y rotation back to 0 and positioned it in the back.

5.  The gable roof consisted of two elevated cubes positioned in the middle of the left and right walls, rotated by 15 & -15 degrees
    respectively and scaled to 6.5x7.5 on its X & Z axis to cover the whole rooftop.

Experience gained:

Eduardo: Even though I didn’t use it for this challenge, I found out how to scale in a singular direction using the rect tool. 
         Doing this house made me get more acquainted with Unity's shortcuts and camera controls to facilitate object placement. 
         For example, holding control while moving an object makes it move in increments. Thus by moving objects that way or just 
         setting its scale, position, or rotation by number, makes for a cleaner more efficient result. Also it is nice learning 
         how we can share together a project in Unity.

Joxanniel: In part thanks to this challenge, I was able to familiarize myself with the scale tool in Unity. Even though I was already 
           aware of what the scale tool did, this project helped me become more in tune with the tool and transformations in general. 
           I also figured that changing the scale, position or rotation by increments is way easier than changing it by number, though 
           you would probably get a cleaner result while doing it by number. I also found this interesting due to the collaborative aspect, 
           since I had never worked with anyone in a game design project before this. 

Jeremy: In the process of completing this challenge, while building the house, I gained experience using some of the different tools unity offers us, such as the rotate and scale tool. Also, I think I learned how to use the camera a bit better, because I struggled quite a bit using the camera angles and the movement properly in the first few classes. An aspect of the project I liked and think taught us the most about unity, was the use of unity cloud and doing a collaborative project, including the trial and error process of downloading each other’s changesets to see the latest and updated file. Finally, I think that doing this activity as a group helped and facilitated the learning process of using unity and its different tools.
